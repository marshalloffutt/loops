# loops

These are my solutions for the Try It Yourself exercises in chapter 4 of [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/) by Eric Matthes.

This chapter introduces for loops to iterate over lists, and teaches the basics of Python's indentation to structure code. We made lists, and performed operations such as slice to operate on and copy parts of the list. We covered tuples as well.
